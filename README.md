# Description
Foundry VTT module for converting the dynamic IP addresses Foundry VTT shows as invitation links to static URLs you can distribute to your players.

The generated links will continue to work even if your IP address changes! No more need to resend links every few weeks, you can bookmark a URL (which helpfully starts with "foundryredirect.com" so you wont forget what it is) and never worry about it again.

After install, Foundry Redirect will generate a URL for your world, and display it in the Invitation Links window.

Native Foundry VTT links will still be shown if you scroll, just in case you need them!
